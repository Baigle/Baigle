- 👋 Hi, I’m @Baigle
- 👀 I’m interested in quality of life, performance, and security
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to help mod creators and folks with altruistic software projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that doesn't require me to show up on time
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me a message on github and I may take a few weeks to see it, but eventually, I will probably see it
